Promesante's Blog

I am actively building professional core competences on:

* Functional Programming Paradigm
* Meta-programming

Combining both of them in the Lisp programming language, mainly in its following dialects:

* [Clojure](http://clojure.org)
* [Racket](http://racket-lang.org) dialects.

I am building them in a hands-on fashion. I hope to go on building them more and more collaboratively, with people with complementary interests and skills, and hopefully team up with them to build nice, useful pieces of software.

Hence, I'd summarize this approach as:

* Learn by doing
* Share what I learn: posts
* Team up by sharing: comments as a conversation

Hence, I am setting this blog as a means for these goals.

Just original, practical experiences will be published. I hope them to be interesting and useful for you. And your comments are more than welcome: actually, the whole blog is just an excuse to initiate a conversation.

So, welcome ! And keep updated !
