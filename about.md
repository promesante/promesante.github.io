My name is Luis M. Rosso.

I am Industrial Engineer and hold an MBA. But my career, and actual interests depicted below, have driven me into Information Technology, getting a so called _T profile_: a _horizontal/generalist one_ complemented with a _vertical/specialist one_.

I have always been very fond of intellectual exploration. Quite wide during my infancy and adolescence: Popular Science, Religion, History, Philosophy... And then, narrower and narrower. As I entered into the Computer Science realm, I've followed the same path: intellectual exploration. Naturally, again, wide at the beginning, and then narrower and narrower, gradually converging into the subjects listed below, and getting as practical, and hopefully useful, as to begin sharing findings here.

This passion for intellectual exploration is the reason why I've chosen this blog's motto:

> "Andando y andando, me vine hasta aquí"...
> ("Wandering and wandering, I've got here")

I've taken it from one of my favorite songs which, in turn, this blog takes its name after:

# Interests

* Functional Programming Paradigm
* Meta-programming

The common denominator is Lisp programming language, as it approaches natively both those broad subjects. Actually, Lisp, rather than a single programming language, is a large, diverse family of dialects. Among them, for the reasons explained below, I am particularly interested in the following ones:

* [Clojure](http://clojure.org)
* [Racket](http://racket-lang.org)


# Approach

My goal is to build core competencies based on these  broad interests. But not alone: I'd rather do it collaboratively with people with complementary interests and skills, and hopefully team up with them to build nice, useful pieces of software:

* Learn by doing
* Share what I learn
* Team up by sharing

Hence, I am setting this blog as a means for these goals.

A detailed list of these interests is shown in the following sections. They will be kept up-to-date, reflecting its permantent changes and evolution.


# Functional Programming Paradigm

In this subject, I am particularly interested in its application to the field of Concurrency and Distributed Computing. And here, [Clojure's](http://clojure.org) concurrency primitives come to the rescue ! And so, I am exploring its application to the following domains:


## Schedulers

AKA cluster managers or resource managers:

* [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/)
* [Mesosphere Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/)
* [Apache Chronos](https://mesos.github.io/chronos/)
* [Hashicorp Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/)
* [Firmament](http://www.firmament.io/)


## Big Data

* [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/)
* [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/)
* [Onyx](http://www.onyxplatform.org/)


## Games

Multiplayer online games (MOGs): [Racket HTDP Universe](https://www.realmofracket.com/)


# Meta-programming

In this subject, I am particulary interested in language development. More specifically: Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). And here, language-development facilities natively supplied by the [Racket programming language](http://racket-lang.org) comes to the rescue ! And so, I am exploring its application to the following domains:


## Big Data

In this field, I am interested in Probabilistic Programming Languages; more specifically:

* [Church](https://probmods.org/)
* [Anglican](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~fwood/anglican/)


## Games

In this field, I am interested in:

**Engines**

* [Racket HTDP Big Bang](https://www.realmofracket.com/)
* [play-clj](https://github.com/oakes/play-clj)


**Artificial Intelligence**: [Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming (PAIP)](http://www.amazon.com/Paradigms-Artificial-Intelligence-Programming-Studies/dp/1558601910)


## Publishing and static site generators

* [Pollen](http://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/)
* [Frog](https://github.com/greghendershott/frog)
* [Cryogen](http://cryogenweb.org/)
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)


# Conclusion

I know these interests are perhaps too wide and disperse. However, I have always tried to keep balance between their unity and diversity, in order to get synergy from their combination. Of cource, I don't plan to either get hands-on experience or publish posts on all of them. But what I actually do about them all is studying, and permanently evaluating which one to invest time and effort on, getting the hands gradually dirty on the most promising ones, at least from my point of view...

Only these cases will be published as posts: just original, practical experiences. I hope them to be interesting and useful for you. And your comments are more than welcome: actually, the whole blog is just an excuse to initiate a conversation.

So, welcome ! And keep updated !
